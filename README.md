# DifferentiableAdaptiveGames
An adaptive game-theoretic planner that jointly infers players' objectives and solves for generalized Nash equilibrium trajectories, enabled by differentiating through a trajectory game solver. This is a software package produced by research [Learning to Play Trajectory Games Against Opponents with Unknown Objectives](https://xinjie-liu.github.io/projects/game/). Please consult the project website for more information.
